## Introduction

Welcome to **Learn You a Mlatu for Great Good!** If you're reading this, chances are you want to learn Mlatu. Well you've come to the right place.

**Learn You a Mlatu for Great Good!** is unabashedly copied off of [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/). This tutorial assumes you have some experience programming in an imperative programming language. If you have experience in a concatenative programming language or a functional programming language, good for you! You'll have an easier time, and should be able to follow along fairly easily.
